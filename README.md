# Responsive Landing Page Website

A responsive landing page website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap 5**, based on a clean and modern design from Figma.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a responsive, multi-section landing page developed with semantic HTML and styled using Bootstrap’s utility classes and custom CSS. The design was taken from a publicly available Figma file and implemented to closely match its layout, spacing, and responsiveness.

🔧 *Note:* Some **minor design changes** were made during development to improve responsiveness and layout consistency.
